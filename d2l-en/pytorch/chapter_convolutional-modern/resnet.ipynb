    "That is, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ there exists some set of parameters (e.g., weights and biases) that can be obtained through training on a suitable dataset.\n",
    "Let's assume that $f^*$ is the \"truth\" function that we really would like to find.\n",
    "If it is in $\\mathcal{F}$, we are in good shape but typically we will not be quite so lucky.\n",
    "Instead, we will try to find some $f^*_\\mathcal{F}$ which is our best bet within $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "For instance,\n",
    "given a dataset with features $\\mathbf{X}$\n",
    "and labels $\\mathbf{y}$,\n",
    "we might try finding it by solving the following optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f^*_\\mathcal{F} \\stackrel{\\textrm{def}}{=} \\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_f L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{y}, f) \\textrm{ subject to } f \\in \\mathcal{F}.$$\n",

    "It is only reasonable to assume that if we design a different and more powerful architecture $\\mathcal{F}'$ we should arrive at a better outcome. In other words, we would expect that $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}'}$ is \"better\" than $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}}$. However, if $\\mathcal{F} \\not\\subseteq \\mathcal{F}'$ there is no guarantee that this should even happen. In fact, $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}'}$ might well be worse.\n",
    "As illustrated by :numref:`fig_functionclasses`,\n",

    "on the left of :numref:`fig_functionclasses`,\n",
    "though $\\mathcal{F}_3$ is closer to $f^*$ than $\\mathcal{F}_1$, $\\mathcal{F}_6$ moves away and there is no guarantee that further increasing the complexity can reduce the distance from $f^*$.\n",

    "One of the challenges one encounters in the design of ResNet is the trade-off between nonlinearity and dimensionality within a given block. That is, we could add more nonlinearity by increasing the number of layers, or by increasing the width of the convolutions. An alternative strategy is to increase the number of channels that can carry information between blocks. Unfortunately, the latter comes with a quadratic penalty since the computational cost of ingesting $c_\\textrm{i}$ channels and emitting $c_\\textrm{o}$ channels is proportional to $\\mathcal{O}(c_\\textrm{i} \\cdot c_\\textrm{o})$ (see our discussion in :numref:`sec_channels`). \n",

    "We can take some inspiration from the Inception block of :numref:`fig_inception` which has information flowing through the block in separate groups. Applying the idea of multiple independent groups to the ResNet block of :numref:`fig_resnet_block` led to the design of ResNeXt :cite:`Xie.Girshick.Dollar.ea.2017`.\n",

    "Breaking up a convolution from $c_\\textrm{i}$ to $c_\\textrm{o}$ channels into one of $g$ groups of size $c_\\textrm{i}/g$ generating $g$ outputs of size $c_\\textrm{o}/g$ is called, quite fittingly, a *grouped convolution*. The computational cost (proportionally) is reduced from $\\mathcal{O}(c_\\textrm{i} \\cdot c_\\textrm{o})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(g \\cdot (c_\\textrm{i}/g) \\cdot (c_\\textrm{o}/g)) = \\mathcal{O}(c_\\textrm{i} \\cdot c_\\textrm{o} / g)$, i.e., it is $g$ times faster. Even better, the number of parameters needed to generate the output is also reduced from a $c_\\textrm{i} \\times c_\\textrm{o}$ matrix to $g$ smaller matrices of size $(c_\\textrm{i}/g) \\times (c_\\textrm{o}/g)$, again a $g$ times reduction. In what follows we assume that both $c_\\textrm{i}$ and $c_\\textrm{o}$ are divisible by $g$. \n",

The second one serves double duty in changing the number of channels back. The benefit is that we only pay the $\\mathcal{O}(c \\cdot b)$ cost for $1 \\times 1$ kernels and can make do with an $\\mathcal{O}(b^2 / g)$ cost for $3 \\times 3$ kernels.

    "\n",
    "Nested function classes are desirable since they allow us to obtain strictly *more powerful* rather than also subtly *different* function classes when adding capacity. One way of accomplishing this is by letting additional layers to simply pass through the input to the output. Residual connections allow for this. As a consequence, this changes the inductive bias from simple functions being of the form $f(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$ to simple functions looking like $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual mapping can learn the identity function more easily, such as pushing parameters in the weight layer to zero. We can train an effective *deep* neural network by having residual blocks. Inputs can forward propagate faster through the residual connections across layers. As a consequence, we can thus train much deeper networks. For instance, the original ResNet paper :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016` allowed for up to 152 layers. Another benefit of residual networks is that it allows us to add layers, initialized as the identity function, *during* the training process. After all, the default behavior of a layer is to let the data pass through unchanged. This can accelerate the training of very large networks in some cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to residual connections,\n",
    "bypassing paths with gating units were introduced\n",
    "to effectively train highway networks with over 100 layers\n",
    ":cite:`srivastava2015highway`.\n",
    "Using identity functions as bypassing paths,\n",
    "ResNet performed remarkably well\n",
    "on multiple computer vision tasks.\n",
    "Residual connections had a major influence on the design of subsequent deep neural networks, of either convolutional or sequential nature.\n",
    "As we will introduce later,\n",
    "the Transformer architecture :cite:`Vaswani.Shazeer.Parmar.ea.2017`\n",
    "adopts residual connections (together with other design choices) and is pervasive\n",
    "in areas as diverse as\n",
    "language, vision, speech, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNeXt is an example for how the design of convolutional neural networks has evolved over time: by being more frugal with computation and trading it off against the size of the activations (number of channels), it allows for faster and more accurate networks at lower cost. An alternative way of viewing grouped convolutions is to think of a block-diagonal matrix for the convolutional weights. Note that there are quite a few such \"tricks\" that lead to more efficient networks. For instance, ShiftNet :cite:`wu2018shift` mimicks the effects of a $3 \\times 3$ convolution, simply by adding shifted activations to the channels, offering increased function complexity, this time without any computational cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common feature of the designs we have discussed so far is that the network design is fairly manual, primarily relying on the ingenuity of the designer to find the \"right\" network hyperparameters. While clearly feasible, it is also very costly in terms of human time and there is no guarantee that the outcome is optimal in any sense. In :numref:`sec_cnn-design` we will discuss a number of strategies for obtaining high quality networks in a more automated fashion. In particular, we will review the notion of *network design spaces* that led to the RegNetX/Y models\n",

    "1. For deeper networks, ResNet introduces a \"bottleneck\" architecture to reduce model complexity. Try to implement it.\n",
    "1. In subsequent versions of ResNet, the authors changed the \"convolution, batch normalization, and activation\" structure to the \"batch normalization, activation, and convolution\" structure. Make this improvement yourself. See Figure 1 in :citet:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016*1` for details.\n",
    "1. Why can't we just increase the complexity of functions without bound, even if the function classes are nested?\n"
